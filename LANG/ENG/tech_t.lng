The sailing of the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USN Nautilus in 1955 was soon followed by similar British, French and Russian boats. Equipment was also developed to extract oxygen from sea water. These two innovations, together with inertial navigation systems, gave submarines the ability to remain submerged for weeks or months, and enabled previously impossible voyages such as the crossing of the North Pole beneath the Arctic ice cap by the USS Nautilus in 1958. Most of the naval submarines built since that time in the United States and the Soviet Union and its successor state the Russian Federation have been powered by nuclear reactors.

However, unlike a nuclear warhead, this will require a direct hit to be effective, thus unlike a typical ballistic missile, which follows a ballistic flight path after the relatively brief initial phase of powered flight, an ASBM would require a precise and high-performance terminal guidance system, with advanced sensors and in-flight calibrations in order to successfully hit a moving target.\n\n\n+Effective Against Large Vessels like cruiser and carriers"

"B1_NAME" LANG "Laser Guided Bombs"
"B1_DESC" LANG "A laser-guided bomb is a guided bomb that uses semi-active laser guidance to strike a designated target with greater accuracy than an unguided bomb. First developed by the United States during the Vietnam War, laser-guided bombs quickly proved their value in precision strikes of difficult point targets. These weapons use on-board electronics to track targets that are designated by laser, typically in the infrared spectrum, and adjust their glide path to accurately strike the target.\n\n\n+Heavy damage Air-Ground Weapon but with limited speed and range.Their large numbers can saturate enemy Air-Defences."

"B2_NAME" LANG "GPS Guided Bombs"
"B2_DESC" LANG "Lessons learned during the first Gulf War showed the value of precision munitions, yet they also highlighted the difficulties in employing themâ€”specifically when visibility of the ground or target from the air was degraded.The problem of poor visibility does not affect satellite-guided weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition and Joint Stand-Off Weapon, which make use of the United States' GPS system for guidance. This weapon can be employed in all weather conditions, without any need for ground support. Because it is possible to jam GPS, the guidance package reverts to inertial navigation in the event of GPS signal loss.\n\n\n+Improves Precision and Range\n\n\n+Increases Payload capacity"

"B3_NAME" LANG "Stand-off Glide Bombs"
"B3_DESC" LANG "A glide bomb or stand-off bomb is a standoff weapon with flight control surfaces to give it a flatter, gliding flight path than that of a conventional bomb without such surfaces. This allows it to be released at a distance from the target rather than right over it, allowing a successful attack without the aircraft needing to survive until reaching the target.\n\n\n+Improves Precision and Range\n\n\n+Increases Payload capacity"

"B4_NAME" LANG "Swarm Stand-off Glide Bombs"
